## Pitch

---
In Shark Invasion, the player plays as a small, vulnerable fish amidst the deep 
blue ocean. The goal is simple: survive and grow! To do so, avoid the 
predators and consume the food before the timer runs out! Beware, predators 
exist above and beneath the ocean.

## Game Plan

### Phase 1

- [X] Fish Moves: *The fish moves left, right, up, and down when the arrow keys
are pressed.*
- [X] Screen Limits: *The fish cannot be moved offscreen, instead it wraps to the 
other side.*
- [X] Spawning Food: *Food randomly spawns within the given boundaries.*
